# R&S 

Research and scratchpad repo containing code samples from books, micro-ideas, exercices, ...
Some code may not work or be optimized as expected.

Most of these have other ways of solving them. 
There are builtins and standard libary modules that are more appropriate for production use.

Inquiries? Requests? Remarks? Suggestions?
